 * loops allow us to iterate through a complex datatype in javascript and perform a task on each item
 * in the array or object, iterating through the container how the programmer choses, whether it be 
 * forwards, backwards, or by any set increment. This iteration process allows us to not write the same 
 * code many times over to complete the same task on similar objects.

  * the syntax of a for loop contains 3 main sections
 *      1. Start - create a counting variable
 *      2. Stop - repeat while condition is true
 *      3. Update - increase or decrease the counting variable
 * 
 * the start and stop statements are both boolean values created upon logic, however the update statement is a unary operator
 * the increment is how much to update each iteration
 * the index is the particular element of the container being accessed
